This is a weather app that utilizes a weather api to pull the data when you search a specific city. It will show you the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index. The UV index changes color depending on the severity of it. There is also a 5 day forecast that shows the temperature, wind speeds, and humidity of the area. 
When you search the city, it will save the information to the local storage and pop up with a button to click on to pull the information again. 
When you select the clear history button, it clears out the local storage.
